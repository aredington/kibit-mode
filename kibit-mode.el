;;; Documentation:
;;
;; This minor mode acts as a compilation mechanism for interactively replacing
;; clojure s-expressions by their more idiomatic representations. It provides
;; the following capabilities:
;;
;;  * Run a check over the currently open file (bound to `\C-c \C-n`). This will
;;    open a compilation mode buffer showing the kibit replacements.
;;
;;  * Implement a suggested replacement (bound to `r`). This will destroy the
;;    extant formatting when the replacement is inserted

;;; Dependencies:
;; This minor mode depends on `mode-compile` and `clojure-mode`.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 0.1 - First cut of kibit-mode
